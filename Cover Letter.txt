I'm writing to express my interest in the __________(Machine Learning Engineer) position at __________(Dematic). I believe that my experience in the autonomy sector makes me a promising candidate. 

I am currently working at Dematic, Kion Mobile Automation as a Machine Learning Engineer. My responsibilities include research and development of robot mapping and localization(SLAM) algorithms for automated guided vehicles(AGVs) in warehouse environments, equipped with sensors like 2D/3D LiDAR, wheel odometry, IMU, and cameras. The software development is mostly done using C++, Python, and Robot Operating System(ROS).

I have a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, focusing on robotics, where I designed algorithms for simulation and synthesis of single-degree-of-freedom closed-loop mechanisms (parallel kinematic robots). During my Ph.D., I also developed SnappyXO, a laser-cut robotics kit to create mechanisms, structures, and robots, which ran a successful crowdfunding campaign. I have also supervised many undergraduates on robotics projects like walking bots, climbing bots, battle bots, biomimetic bots, self-driving cars, and drones.

As a part of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree program, I have worked with critical autonomous driving technologies like computer vision, deep learning, sensor fusion, localization, motion planning, behavior control, and system integration.

Thus, I'm confident that I am a good fit for the role and look forward to hearing back from you.
