I am currently working at Dematic, Kion Mobile Automation as a Machine Learning Engineer. My work here directly involves robot mapping and localization(SLAM) algorithms, machine learning, and software development for automated guided vehicles(AGVs) in warehouse environments. 

I have a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering, focusing on robotics and design, where I designed algorithms for simulation and synthesis of single-degree-of-freedom closed-loop mechanisms (parallel kinematic robots). During my Ph.D., I also developed SnappyXO, a laser-cut robotics kit to design mechanisms, structures, and robots, which ran a successful crowdfunding campaign. I have also supervised many undergraduates on robotics projects like walking bots, climbing bots, battle bots, biomimetic bots, self-driving cars, and drones.

As a part of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree program, I have worked with critical autonomous driving technologies like computer vision, deep learning, sensor fusion, localization, motion planning, behavior control, and system integration.

Thus, I believe that I am a good fit for the role.
